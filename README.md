There are 2 functions in the script:

### Create twins ###
This copies each item in your selection and gives the same name to each clone.

### Rename Selection and Twin ###
Run this after you have moved each of the clone pieces to it bin.

Select all the clone pieces in a bin, then run this (option 2) of the script.

It will ask you for a **basename**. This should probably be your bin name, like **A-**.

It will rename each of the selected clones, and each matching original piece.

It also creates a text label on top of and grouped to each piece.
