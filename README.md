## Operation ##
There are 2 functions in the script:

### Clone and Entangle ###
This clones each item in your selection and gives the same name to each clone.

### Rename Clones ###
Run this after you have moved each of the clone pieces to its bin.

Select all the clone pieces in a bin, then run this (option 2) of the script.

It will ask you for:

1. A **basename**. This should probably be your bin name, like '**A**'.
1. A **sort order**.
1. A **starting number**.

It will rename each of the selected clones, and each matching original piece.

It also creates a text label on top of and grouped to each piece.
